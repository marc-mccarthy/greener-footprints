# Solo Scope Document - First Draft

## Solo Project Requirements

Your solo project must include CRUD with Authentication. This means that your application must register and log-in users, preventing access to all or some part of the application and its data for non-logged in users.

> For example: you may have an application where all data is publicly viewable (Read), but only a logged in user is able to Create, Update or Delete data.

Application data that is not public must also be protected from direct access to the server from applications such as Postman.

## Scope Requirements

The first draft of your scope document must include **wireframes**, an **entity relationship diagram** and a **description of each feature in your application**. Please include as much detail as possible. The goal of this document is that you could hand it to another developer and feel confident they could build your application.

[Review this Checklist as you go!](./scope-checklist.md) Instructors will be looking for all these things!

### Make a copy of the scope doc, share access, start research

- [Scope Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cc9XmPUUp-_Q4ynYIr4-2ev7wFx0552b3y8mO8jT8oI/edit)
  - Make a copy. File > Make a copy...
  - Share your google doc (edit access) with all instructors
    - <fse-staff@primeacademy.io>

### Wireframe or mockup options

A wireframe is required for each view. A submission without a wireframe for each view will not receive feedback. These **MUST** be digital and included in your scope document.

- https://www.figma.com/ (Recommended!)
    - [Here is a Guide to get you started!](https://www.notion.so/primedigitalacademy/Figma-for-Fullstack-82b8053dd2024cafb1eab15b83b7fa24)
- Hand drawn is OK, but it must be digital and placed in your scope document!

With each wireframe, there should be a text description of all features and functionality shown in that view.

### Database Diagram/ERD

A few ERD creation tools we like:

- https://dbdesigner.net  (Recommended!)
  - free for first two database diagrams, 1 year free ultimate edition if students follow guidance in ERD lecture
  - can export to postgres
  - students have had issues with saving here, so try saving early and often so you don't lose your work

- https://dbdiagram.io
  - free
  - build erd from text (can be faster to build)
